Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Docs & status tracking

All design / planning / reference docs live under `docs/` (`docs/design/`, `docs/planning/`,
`docs/reference/`). The cross-cutting work-item ledger `TODOS.md` stays at the repo root.
Archive obsolete docs under `docs/archive/` (create it when first needed).

**`docs/STATUS.md` is the single source of truth for documentation status.**

- **At session start:** read `docs/STATUS.md` to see what is built (`done`), partial
  (`in-progress`), reference-only (`living`), or has a stale header. Trust STATUS over any
  individual doc's own header — several doc headers claim "not started" / "pre-build" but
  are actually shipped.
- **At session end:** update `docs/STATUS.md` whenever a doc's real build status changed, or
  a doc was added / moved / archived. Update the row's Status + Scope to match the *code
  reality* (verify against `db/migrations/`, `ingest/`, `web/src/`), add or relocate rows as
  needed, and bump the **Last updated** date.
- Do **not** hand-edit `docs/reference/data-dictionary.md` — it is generated
  (`python -m transitindex_ingest.dictionary`).
